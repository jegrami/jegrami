# Welcome!

#### Thanks for checking my profile!

I'm Jeremiah, a technical writer and Python developer.
__Open source__ advocate and __accessiblity developer__. @a11yproject.

I believe technology is for everyone, and accessibility is a human right.

I'm in the early days of my career, so there aren't many cool stuff here (yet!). 
It's a work in progress.ðŸš€
