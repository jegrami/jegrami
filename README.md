##### About Me

I'm a former copyeditor turned technical writer plodding toward a career in data and software engineering. 

No grand ambitions here ‚Äî just a humble passion for coding, sprinkled with a dash of geekiness and a knack for programming arcana.

My hobbies include code poetry, retro programming anecdotes, self-effacement, and a passion for the nerdy side of tech.

#### What I Hope to Achieve with My GitHub Page :octocat:

GitHub is arguably the most important platform in our digital universe. I plan to develop a presence here reflecting my passion for coding and my journey from writing words to writing code. 

#### What you'll find here: 

* Code written with storytelling flair. 
* Pythonic musings, talks about internet technologies, and a sprinkle of interesting projects I build as I learn.
