# Welcome to My Data Engineering Journey! ðŸš€

## What does a data engineer do? 

Data engineers build and maintain the systems and processes (often called *pipelines*) that take in raw data and transform it into high-quality information for analytics, reporting, and machine learning. Beyond their basic duty of extracting, transforming, and loading data (ETL), data engineers are also responsible for managing **the data engineering lifecycle** â€” which begins from when data is generated in source systems to when it's served for downstream use cases.

## About me

I'm Jeremiah, a copyeditor turned technical writer venturing into the crucial and exciting world of data engineering. I have an insatiable curiosity for technology and the immense potential of data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can shape the future. I love the idea of moving data around and building systems that efficiently process and deliver high-quality data to my customers, namely **data scientists**, **machine learning engineers**, and **business analysts**.
