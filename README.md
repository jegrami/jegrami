#### Hi, I'm Jeremiah üêº

A writer in the midst of a tech odyssey, exploring Python, data engineering, and the history of bites and bytes.

##### About Me

I'm a former copyeditor turned technical writer plodding toward a career in data and software engineering. 

No grand illusions here ‚Äî just a humble passion for coding, sprinkled with a dash of geekiness and a knack for programming arcana.

My hobbies include code poetry, retro programming anecdotes, self-effacement, and a passion for the nerdy side of tech.

#### What I Hope to Achieve with My GitHub Page :octocat:

GitHub is arguably the most important platform in our digital universe. I plan to develop a presence here reflecting my passion for coding, celebrating my command line heroes, and narrating my journey from writing words to writing code. 

#### What you'll find here: 

‚óªÔ∏è Code written with storytelling flair. 
‚óªÔ∏è Tech tales and occasional programming jokes.
‚óªÔ∏è Pythonic musings, data talks, and a sprinkle of interesting projects I build as I learn.
